# Summary: Brain Connectivity in Schizophrenia

This study analyzed EEG data from 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls to understand brain connectivity differences.

## Findings:

- **Sample Size:** 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls.
- **Connectivity Measures:** Phase-Locking Value (PLV), Phase-Lag Index (PLI), and Directed Transfer Function (DTF).
- **Main Results:**
    - Schizophrenic patients showed reduced connectivity strength, altered clustering coefficient, and characteristic path length, particularly in the alpha band.
    - Different referencing techniques (CSD, AVERAGE, REST) influenced connectivity results.
    - Graph-based analysis provided insights into disconnectivity disorders.

## Conclusion:

Comparison of connectivity measures using graph-based analysis aids in understanding schizophrenia's neural underpinnings.
